# DataBicycle


Database client application. Created as a part of homework project on "Basics of databases an knowlege bases design" subject in Bauman Moscow State Tecnical University (BMSTU), SM4 "High precision airborne devices" subdepartment.
This application is a prototype of a non-lethal weapons information system. It comes with database that has one-to-many and many-to-many relationships and has some mock values (representing such devices). Application allows to navigate through database, to perform a search and represents its contents in a fancy form.

Microsoft SQL Server service is required to run this app properly!
After building an app, copy database file (BicycleDB.mdf) to your bin/debug or bin/release folder (where your executable resides)
